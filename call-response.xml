Then the next piece of information is the rating of the session that is from 1 to 5 (5 being the best). After the number rating, add another space and write any additional comments youâ€™d like to send in with your vote. Thanks again for calling. Have you lost weight? Enjoy the rest of CSS Dev Conf New Orleans.</Say>
